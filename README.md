# Openshift

General project for playing about with Openshift.
The hitlist project has a flask application and a mysql backend.

I developed this so that I could understand the application completely.  Therefore debugging deployment to Kubernetes was a simpler process.
Contains argoCD examples, Tekton pipelines and such.  

Work in progress, will be moved into various repositories at some point.
